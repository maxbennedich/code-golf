# Code Golf

Programs written in as few characters as possible. Purely for recreational purposes, not examples of good or useful code.

For brevity, the C# scripts do not include class and method declarations, just the script itself. They can be executed in a C# REPL / script executor (check out [this one](https://github.com/maxbennedich/dotnet-repl)!), the C# Interactive window in Visual Studio, or simply placed inside a Main method in an empty program.

The graphical scripts look best with a font that renders the graphic characters properly. I've used the built-in Windows font `Terminal` with size 5 / 4x6 pixels in the screenshots.
